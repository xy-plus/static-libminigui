### What's new in this version

In this version, we mainly enhanced and tuned the APIs related to text
rendering in order that MiniGUI can handle complex writing systems
(scripts) like Arabic and Indic:

* MiniGUI now provides complete APIs for Unicode characters processing.
  These APIs conform to Unicode 12.0, including the Unicode
  Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9), Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm
  (UAX #14), Unicode Normalization Forms (UAX #15), Unicode Script Property
  (UAX #24), Unicode Text Segmentation (UAX #29), Unicode Vertical
  Text Layout (UAX #50), and so on.

* MiniGUI also provides new APIs to lay out, shape, and render glyphs
  from complex and mixed scripts, such as Arabic, Thai, and Indic.
  The new APIs also conform to the specifications of [CSS Text Module Level 3]
  and [CSS Writing Modes Level 3].

* We tuned and optimized MiniGUI's logical and device font interfaces to
  support the new features above.

* MiniGUI now is enhanced to support input events which may be generated
  by input devices other than standard mouse (or single-touch panel) and
  keyboard, such as multi-touch panel (gesture), joystick, tablet tool,
  and switch. In MiniGUI 4.0, we introduce `MSG_EXIN_XXX` messages to support
  the input events from devices other than standard mouse and keyboard. We
  call these messages as 'extra input messages'.

Another important features of this version are the new following engines:

* The NEWGAL engine of `dri` to support modern DRM-driven graphics cards. By using
  `dri` engine, one MiniGUI app can now use the hardware-accelerated graphics
  rendering for 2D/3D graphics.
* The IAL engine of `libinput` to support all modern input devices including
  mouse, keyboard, joystick, switch, multi-touch panel, gesture, tablet tool,
  and table pad.
* The enhanced IAL engine of `random` to generate extra input messages
  automatically for testing.

At last, we introduced a Slice Memory Allocator for fast concurrent memory
chunk allocation.

The following sections will describe these new features in detail.

#### New APIs conforming Unicode 12.0

* New types:
    1. `Uchar32`: the Unicode code point value of a Unicode character.
    1. `Achar32`: the abstract character index value under a certain
        charset/encoding. Under Unicode charset or encodings, the
        abstract character index value will be identical to the Unicode
        code point, i.e., Achar32 is equivalent to Uchar32 under this
        situation.
    1. `Glyph32`: the glyph index value in a device font. Note that
        a Glyph32 value is always bound to a specific logfont object.

* New functions to determine the Unicode character properties:
    1. `UCharGetCategory` for getting the general category of
        a Unicode character.
    1. `UCharGetBreakType` for getting the breaking type of
        a Unicode character.
    1. `UStrGetBreaks` for getting the breaking types of
        a Unicode string.
    1. `UCharGetBidiType` for getting the bidi type of
        a Unicode character.
    1. `UStrGetBidiTypes` for getting the bidi types of a Unicode
        character string.
    1. `UCharGetBracketType` for getting the bracketed character of a
        Uchar32 character.
    1. `UStrGetBracketTypes` for getting the bracketed characters of a
        Uchar32 string.
    1. `UCharGetMirror` for getting the mirrored character of a Uchar32
        character.
    1. `UCharGetJoiningType` for getting the joining type of a Uchar32
        character.
    1. `UStrGetJoiningTypes` for getting the joining types of a Uchar32
        string.
    1. `UBidiGetParagraphDir` for getting the base paragraph direction
        of a single paragraph.
    1. `UBidiGetParagraphEmbeddingLevels` for getting the bidi embedding
        levels of a paragraph.
    1. `UBidiReorderLine`, `UBidiShapeMirroring`, `UBidiJoinArabic`,
        ` UBidiShapeArabic`, and `UBidiShape` for doing bidi-aware
        mirroring, joining, and shaping.
    1. `UCharGetScriptType` for getting the script type of a Uchar32
        character.

MiniGUI also provides some utilities/helpers for Unicode character
conversion, such as from lower case to upper case, single width to
full width. Please see MiniGUI API reference document for the detailed
description.

#### New APIs for mixed scripts

To lay out, shape, and render a text in mixed scripts, you should call
`GetUCharsUntilParagraphBoundary` function first to convert
a multi-byte string to a Unicode string under the specified white space
rule, breaking rule, and transformation rule. For example, converting a
general C string in UTF-8 or GB18030 to a Uchar32 string by calling this
function. You can call `CreateLogFontForMChar2UChar` function to create
a dummy logfont object for this purpose in order to expense a minimal memory.

If the text is in simple scripts, like Latin or Chinese, you can call
`GetGlyphsExtentFromUChars` function to lay out the paragraph. This function
returns a glyph string which can fit in a line with the specified
maximal extent and rendering flags. After this, you call
`DrawGlyphStringEx` function to draw the glyph string to the
specific position of a DC.

If the text is in complex and/or mixed scripts, like Arabic, Thai,
and Indic, you should create a TEXTRUNS object first by calling
`CreateTextRuns` function, then initialize the shaping engine for
laying out the text.

MiniGUI provides two types of shaping engine. One is the basic
shaping engine. The corresponding function is `InitBasicShapingEngine`.
The other is called complex shaping engine, which is based on HarfBuzz.
The corresponding function is `InitComplexShapingEngine`. The latter
one can give you a better shaping result.

After this, you should call `CreateLayout` to create a layout object
for laying out the text, then call `LayoutNextLine` to lay out the lines
one by one.

You can render the laid out lines by calling `DrawLayoutLine` function.

Finally, you call `DestroyLayout` and `DestroyTextRuns` to destroy
the layout object and text runs object.

Before rendering the glyphs laid out, you can also call `GetLayoutLineRect`
to get the line rectangle, or call `CalcLayoutBoundingRect` to get
the bounding rectangle of one paragraph.

These new APIs provide a very flexible implementation for your apps
to process the complex scripts. The implementation is derived from
LGPL'd Pango, but we optimize and simplify the original implementation
in the following respects:

* We split the layout process into two stages. We get the text runs
  (Pango items) in the first stage, and the text runs will keep as
  constants for subsequent different layouts. In the second stage,
  we create a layout object for a set of specific layout parameters,
  and generates the lines one by one for the caller. This is useful
  for an app like browser, it can reuse the text runs if the output
  width or height changed, and it is no need to re-generate the text
  runs because of the size change of the output rectangle.

* We use MiniGUI's fontname for the font attributes of text, and leave
  the font selection and the glyph generating to MiniGUI's logfont
  module. In this way, we simplify the layout process greatly.

* We always use Uchar32 string for the whole layout process. So the
  code and the structures are clearer than original implementation.

* We provide two shaping engines for rendering the text. One is a
  basic shaping engine and other is the complex shaping engine based
  on HarfBuzz. The former can be used for some simple applications.

#### Enhanced logical font APIs

The styles of LOGFONT changed.

* Add new rendering style:
  1. `FS_RENDER_ANY`: Not specified.
  1. `FS_RENDER_MONO`:
  1. `FS_RENDER_GREY`:
  1. `FS_RENDER_SUBPIXEL`:
* Some old styles are deprecated:
  1. `FS_WEIGHT_BOOK`; use `FS_RENDER_GREY` instead.
  1. `FS_WEIGHT_SUBPIXEL`; use `FS_RENDER_SUBPIXEL` instead.
* Introduced or redefined the weight styles to follow OpenType specification:
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_ANY`: Not specified.
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_THIN`: Thin.
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_EXTRA_LIGHT`: Extra light (Ultra Light).
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_LIGHT`: Light.
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_REGULAR`: Regular (Normal).
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_MEDIUM`: Medium.
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_DEMIBOLD`: Demi Bold (Semi Bold)
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_BOLD`: Bold.
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_EXTRA_BOLD`: Extra Bold (Ultra Bold).
  1. `FONT_WEIGHT_BLACK`: Black (Heavy).
* Introduce the new decoration styles and replace
`FONT_UNDERLINE_LINE` and `FONT_STRUCKOUT_LINE` with them:
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_ANY`: Not specified.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_NONE`: None.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_UNDERLINE`: glyphs are underscored.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_STRUCKOUT`: glyphs are overstruck.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_US`: Both `FONT_DECORATE_UNDERLINE`
and `FONT_DECORATE_STRUCKOUT`.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_OUTLINE`: Outline (hollow) glyphs.
  1. `FONT_DECORATE_REVERSE`: Reserved for future. Glyphs have their
foreground and background reversed.
* The following style are deprecated:
  1. `FONT_OTHER_LCDPORTRAIT`
  1. `FONT_OTHER_LCDPORTRAITKERN`

For a new app, you should use the new function `CreateLogFontEx` to
create a LOGFONT, and specify the weight and rendering method of the glyph.

For the back-compatibility, you can still use `CreateLogFont` to create a new
LOGFONT. However, `FS_WEIGHT_BOOK` will be treated `FS_WEIGHT_REGULAR` and
`FS_RENDER_GREY`, while `FS_WEIGHT_SUBPIXEL` will be treated
`FS_WEIGHT_REGULAR` and `FS_RENDER_SUBPIXEL`.

You can still use `CreateLogFontByName` to create a new LOGFONT.
But the style string in the font name changed from

    <weight><slant><flipping><other><underline><struckout>

to

    <weight><slant><flipping><other><decoration><rendering>

Note that `<underline>` and `<struckout>` are merged to `<decoration>`
in order to keep the style string is still 6-character long.

Consequently, if you want to use the rendering method SUPIXEL for a TTF font,
please define the logical font name in the following way:

    ttf-Courier-rrncns-*-16-UTF-8

Moreover, the family name of a DEVFONT supports aliases since 4.0.0:

    <fonttype>-<family[,aliase]*>-<styles>-<width>-<height>-<charset[,charset]*>

for example:

    ttf-Arial,Sans Serif-rrncnn-8-16-ISO8859-1,UTF-8
    ttf-courier,monospace,serif-rrncnn-8-16-ISO8859-1,UTF-8

Note that the length of one DEVFONT name can not exceed 255 bytes.

Since version 4.0.0, you can specify up to 7 family names for a logfont name,
such as:

    ttf-Courier,宋体,Naskh,SansSerif-rrncns-U-16-UTF-8

In this way, you can specify a logfont to use multiple devfonts
to render a complex text. This is useful when different glyphs are
contained in different font files. It is well known that, a font is
often designed for a particular language/script or a few similar
languages/scripts.

Since 4.0.0, the previous width field of a logfont name is used for
the glyph orientation:

- 'U': Glyphs stand upright (default).
- 'S': Glyphs are rotated 90 degrees clockwise (sideways).
- 'D': Glyphs are upside-down.
- 'L': Glyphs are rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (sideways left).

#### Support for Linux DRI/DRM

In order to support modern graphics card or GPU, we introduced a
new NEWGAL engine of `dri`. The developer can use this engine to
run MiniGUI apps on a Linux box on which the DRI
(Direct Rendering Infrastructure) is enabled.

The `dri` engine uses `libdrm` developed by Free Desktop project:

https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/

Libdrm is a user-space library implements the Direct Rendering Manager.
MiniGUI mainly uses this library to support the dumb frame buffer
(no hardware acceleration). However, you can write a driver for your
graphics card or GPU to implement the hardware accelerated features.

To avoid modifying the MiniGUI source code when supporting a new GPU,
the `dri` engine has adopted a scalable design:

* You can directly use the `dri` engine to run MiniGUI on a GPU
which supports dumb frame buffer.
* When you want to take advantage of the hardware acceleration of
your GPU, you can write some code for your GPU as a sub driver
of `dri` engine outside MiniGUI.

In this situation, you need to configure MiniGUI with the following
option:

    --with-targetname=external

and implement the sub driver in your MiniGUI apps.

The header file `<minigui/exstubs.h>` defines the operators (a set of
callback functions) you need to implement for your GPU externally.

As an example, we implement the sub driver for `i915` graphics chard
in `mg-tests/dri-engine/`. Please refer to `mg-tests` repository.

To exploit the GPU's accelerated rendering capabilities, a MiniGUI app
can use `cairo` and/or `OpenGL ES` to assist in rendering 2D/3D graphics
when using the `dri` engine. We will provide some samples in `mg-tests`
or `mg-samples` for this purpose.

Note that for `dri` engine, we introduce a new section in MiniGUI runtime
configuration:

```
[dri]
defaultmode=1024x768-32bpp
pixelformat=XR24
device=/dev/dri/card0
dpi=96
```

You can use the key `dri.device` to specify your DRI device.

You can use the key `dri.pixelformat` to specify the DRM pixel format for the
screen. We use DRM fourcc code to defined the pixel format of the screen
surface. For more information, please see `<drm/drm_fourcc.h>` header file.
Note that only 8/16/24/32 bpp RGB formats are supported. For example, `XR24`
means `X8R8G8B8` pixel format.

Currently, the `dri` NEWGAL engine does not provide support for
MiniGUI-Processes run-time mode. We will enhance this in the subsequent
version of MiniGUI.

Also note that when you use the hardware accelerated sub driver, MiniGUI app
may need the root privilege to call `drmSetMaster` to set the video mode.
However, under MiniGUI-Processes run-time mode, only the server (`mginit`) will
need this privilege when you use the future `dri` engine.

#### Extra input messages

In MiniGUI 4.0.0, we introduce the extra input messages to support modern
input devices including multiple touch panel, gesture, tablet tool, and
table pad.

The extra input messages have the prefix `MSG_EXIN_`. If a MiniGUI app
want to handle these extra input events such as gestures, you need
to handle the `MSG_EXIN_XXX` messages in the app. For examples, please
refer to `mg-tests/extra-input/`.

Currently, there are two built-in IAL engines which can generates
the extra input messages:

* The IAL engine of `libinput` to support all modern input devices on a
Linux box. This engine runs on `libinput` introduced by Free Desktop project.

* The enhanced IAL engine of `random` to generate extra input messages
  automatically for testing.

You can also write your own IAL engines to generate the extra messages.
Please see the implementation of `libinput` and `random` engines for
the details.

For `libinput` engine, we introduce a new section in MiniGUI runtime
configuration:

```
[libinput]
seat=seat0
```

The key `libinput.seat` specifies the seat identifier, the default
is `seat0`.

For `random` engine, we introduce a new section in MiniGUI runtime
configuration:

```
[random]
logfile=events.out
eventtypes=mouse-keyboard-button-gesture-stouch
minkeycode=1
maxkeycode=128
minbtncode=0x100
maxbtncode=0x1ff
```

The MiniGUI runtime configuration key `random.logfile` specifies
the log file which will store the input events generated by this engine.
If MiniGUI failed to open the log file, the log feature will be disabled.

The MiniGUI runtime configuration key `random.eventtypes` specifies
the input event types which will be generated by this IAL engine,
in the following pattern:

    <event-type>[-<event-type>]*

The `<event-type>` can be one of the following values:

 - `mouse`: mouse.
 - `keyboard`: keyboard.
 - `button`: buttons.
 - `single_touch`: touch pen or single touch panel.
 - `multi_touch`: multiple touch panel.
 - `gesture`: gesture.
 - `tablet_tool`: tablet tool.
 - `tablet_pad`: tablet pad.
 - `switch`: switch.

The MiniGUI ETC key `random.minkeycode` specifies the minimal key code
which can be generated by the engine if `keyboard` is included.

The MiniGUI ETC key `random.maxkeycode` specifies the maximal key code
which can be generated by the engine if `keyboard` is included.

The MiniGUI ETC key `random.minbtncode` specifies the minimal button code
which can be generated by the engine if `button` is included.

The MiniGUI ETC key `random.maxbtncode` specifies the maximal key code
which can be generated by the engine if `button` is included.

For invalid `random.eventtyps`, the engine uses `mouse` as default.

For invalid `random.minkeycode`, and/or `random.maxkeycode` key values,
the engine uses `SCANCODE_ESCAPE`, and `SCANCODE_MICMUTE` respectively.

For invalid `random.minbtncode`, and/or `random.maxbtncode` key values, use
`0x100` (`BTN_MISC` defined by Linux kernel), and `0x2ff` (`KEY_MAX` defined by
Linux kernel) respectively.

This engine maintains a state machine for each input event type, and
generates a reasonable event sequence for each type. If and only if
an event sequence finished or cancelled, the engine switch to another
event type randomly.

Note that currently, the following event types (in `random` engine)
are not implemented:

 - `multi_touch`
 - `tablet_tool`
 - `tablet_pad`
 - `switch`

#### Slice allocator

MiniGUI now provides an efficient way to allocate groups of equal-sized
chunks of memory.

Memory slices provide a space-efficient and multi-processing scalable
way to allocate equal-sized pieces of memory, just like the
MiniGUI's block data heap. Relative to the standard malloc function
and block data heap, this allocator can avoid excessive memory-waste,
scalability and performance problems.

The following APIs are introduced:

* `mg_slice_alloc` to allocate a given size trunk of memory.
* `mg_slice_free` to free a given size trunk of memory.
* `mg_slice_new` to allocate a memory for a given structure.
* `mg_slice_delete` to free a memory for a given structure.

We use the slice allocator when laying out the text in complex scripts.

Note that this implementation is derived from LGPL'd glib.

#### Other enhancements

* A new BITMAP type `BMP_TYPE_REPLACEKEY` was added. When `bmType` of
a BITMAP object has this bit set, any pixel which is equal to
`bmColorKey` will be replaced by `bmColorRep`.

* More key scancodes are defined for modern keyboard, and the `NR_KEYS`
is re-defined to be 250.

* Support for libPNG 1.6.x.

* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

* Support for GCC 7.

#### Backward compatibility issues

In MiniGUI 4.0.0, we changed some unreasonable APIs which were introduced
in early versions. There are also other changes broke the backward
compatibility. This section gives you a summary about these changes.

* Rename `UChar32` to `Uchar32` and `UChar16` to `Uchar16` in order to
  avoid the conflict with typedef of UChar32 in the system header
  `<unicode/umachine.h>`.
* Rename `mg_FT_LcdFilter` to `FT2LCDFilter` in order to follow MiniGUI
  naming rules.
* Redefine `Uchar32` and `Glyph32` as `Uint32` instead of `int`.

In early versions, we did not significantly distinguish between
characters and glyphs. This will lead to some confusion. Therefore,
we introduce a new type called `Achar32`, which is the character's
index value under a certain charset/encoding. While the type `Glyph32`
is the index value of a glyph in a font.

In order to reflect the correct character and glyph concepts,
the following functions are removed:

  * GetGlyphType, use GetACharType instead.
  * GetGlyphShape, use GetShapedAChar instead.
  * GetGlyphBIDIType, use GetACharBidiType

The names of the following functions are changed:

  * BIDIGetTextLogicalGlyphs -> BIDIGetTextLogicalAChars
  * BIDIGetTextVisualGlyphs -> BIDIGetTextVisualAChars
  * BIDILogAChars2VisGlyphs -> BIDILogAChars2VisAChars
  * BIDILogAChars2VisGlyphsEx -> BIDILogAChars2VisACharsEx

The following functions are deprecated, you should use
the new Unicode version instead:

  * BIDIGetTextLogicalAChars
  * BIDIGetTextVisualAChars
  * BIDILogAChars2VisAChars
  * BIDILogAChars2VisACharsEx
  * BIDIGetTextRangesLog2Vis
  * BIDIGetLogicalEmbedLevelsEx

The following functions are deprecated:

  * GetGlyphBitmap, use GetGlyphInfo instead.

The fields `height` and `descent` have been removed from GLYPHINFO structure.
You should get the font metrics information by calling `GetFontMetrics` function
if you want to get the height and descent data of one font.

The the basic glyph type and break type have been removed from GLYPHINFO
structure. You should use `GetACharType` instead.

#### Deprecated features

Support for FreeType1 was removed.

You should always use FreeType2 to support vector fonts, such as TrueType
fonts (TTF), TrueType collections (TTC), OpenType fonts (OTF, both TrueType
and CFF variants), OpenType collections (OTC), and Type 1 fonts (PFA and PFB).

## Version 3.2.0

The MiniGUI development team announces the availability of MiniGUI 3.2.0.
All users of MiniGUI are recommended strongly to use this version for new
MiniGUI apps. Please report any bugs and incompatibilities in

https://github.com/VincentWei/minigui

### What's new in this version

  * Support for 64-bit platform. Note that the definitions of some types
    and APIs changed.
  * Compliant to the latest GCC, and eliminate all compilation warnings.

### Type changes

#### Changes of handle types

All handle types, including `GHANDLE`, `HWND`, `HDC`, etc.,
are now defined as aliases of `PVOID` (`typedef void* PVOID`).
You may need to check your code to reflect this change.

#### Changes of integer types.

The type of `DWORD` now has pointer precision. That is,
the size of `DWORD` will be 4 bytes on 32-bit platform, and 8 bytes on
64-bit platform.

Similarly, `WPARAM` and `LPARAM` now have pointer precision.

`WORD` and `SWORD` has a half of pointer precision. The size of these
two types is 2 bytes on 32-bit platform, and 4 bytes on 64-bit platform.

`RGBCOLOR` now is defined as an alias of `DWORD32` (see below).

Note that the type of `BYTE` always has the size of 8-bit on both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

#### New integer types:

We introduce `DWORD32` and `SDWORD32` types,
which have the size of 4 bytes on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
You should use these types when reading/writing 32-bit integers from
a binary files for the portability. Of course, you can also use
`Uint32` or `Sint32` types.

Similarly, we introduce `WORD16` and `SWORD16` types,
which have the size of 2 bytes on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
You should use these types when reading/writing 16-bit integers from
a binary file for the portability. Of course, you can also use
`Uint16` or `SUint16` types.

`LRESULT` is defined for window callback procedure, and it has
pointer precision.

`LINT` is a new integer type with pointer precision.

### API changes

#### Integer macros

`MAKEWPARAM`: this new macro makes a WPARAM value by using four bytes.
On the contrary, `FIRSTBYTE`, `SECONDBYTE`, `THIRDBYTE`, and `FOURTH`
macros get the four bytes from a `WPARAM` or a `Uint32` value.

`MAKEWORD16`: this new macro makes a 16-bit word by using two bytes.
Meanwhile, `MAKEWORD` makes a 16-bit word on 32-bit platform, and a 32-bit
word on 64-bit platform.

Note that `MAKELONG` macro always makes a `DWORD` integer, which has pointer
precision. Meanwhile, `MAKELONG32` macro makes a `Uint32` integer.

Note that `MakeRGB` and `MakeRGBA` macros always make `DWORD32` integers.
In contract, `GetRValue`, `GetRValue`, `GetBValue`, `GetAValue` always
get red, green, blue, and alpha components from a `DWORD32` integer
respectively.

Note that you should use `(-1)` instead of `0xFFFFFFFF` for the invalid
integer or pointer type value for good portability.

#### Structure and functions

The main changes in structure and functions:

 * We now use a `UINT` instead of an `int` integer for the message identifier.

 * We now use a `DWORD` integer for the time tick count. Meanwhile, you can
    create 64 timers on 64-bit platform.

 * We now use a `LRESULT` integer for the return value of a window callback
    procedure. Now it is safe to return a pointer from the callback procedure
    on 64-bit platform. This is a very important change, and it will break the
    source compatibilty of your code. You should check the source code (use
    gcc option `-Wall`) carefully.

 * We now use a `LINT` integer for the identifier of a timer. So you can pass
    a pointer as the identifier of the timer on 64-bit platform. mGNCS uses
    MiniGUI timer in this manner.

 * We now use a `LINT` integer for the identifier of a control/widget and a
    menu item. So you can pass a pointer as the identifier of the timer on
    64-bit platform. mGNCS works in this manner.

##### Message

The strcuture `MSG` and all message-related functions changed.
For example, the prototype of `SendMessage` changed from

    int SendMessage (HWND hWnd, int nMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

to

    LRESULT SendMessage (HWND hWnd, UINT nMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

_IMPORTANT NOTE_

For best portability, you should use `FIRSTBYTE` to `FOURTHBYTE` macros
to get the bytes of a character when you extract the bytes from `WPARAM`
parameter of a `MSG_CHAR` message:

    MSG_CHAR
    unsigned char ch_buff [4];
    unsigned char ch_buff [0] = FIRSTBYTE(wParam);
    unsigned char ch_buff [1] = SECONDBYTE(wParam);
    unsigned char ch_buff [2] = THIRDBYTE(wParam);
    unsigned char ch_buff [3] = FOURTHBYTE(wParam);

##### Window callback procedure

Furthermore, the structure and functions to register window class,
create main window, and create dialog box changed. For example, the prototype
of `WNDPROC` changed from

    typedef int (* WNDPROC)(HWND, int, WPARAM, LPARAM)

to

    typedef LRESULT (* WNDPROC)(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM)

Therefore, the prototype of `DefaultWindowProc` changed from

    int DefaultWindowProc (HWND hWnd, int message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

to

    LRESULT DefaultWindowProc (HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)

All main window procedures, control class procedures, and dialog box procedures
defined by your app should change the implementation to reflect the changes
above.

_IMPORTANT NOTE_

Do not cast the result returned by a window procedure to `int` on 64-bit
platform, unless you know what your are doing.

##### Notification callback procedure

The type of notification callback changes from:

    typedef void (* NOTIFPROC) (HWND hwnd, int id, int nc, DWORD add_data);

to

    typedef void (* NOTIFPROC) (HWND hwnd, LINT id, int nc, DWORD add_data);

_IMPORTANT NOTE_

If you use `MSG_COMMAND` message to handle the notification sent from children
controls, you should make sure the identifier is small enough on 64-bit
platform. Because MiniGUI packs the identifier and the notification code
in the `WPARAM` parameter:

    MSG_COMMAND
    int id = LOWORD(wParam);
    int code = HIWORD(wParam);
    HWND hwnd = (HWND)lParam;

The code above will not work on 64-bit if you use a pointer as the identifier
of the control.

Therefore, we recommend strongly that you use a `NOTIFYPOROC` callback to
handle the notification sent from controls. To do this, please call
`SetNotificationCallback` function to set the notification callback function.

##### Time and timer

The prototype of `GetTickCount` changed from

    unsigned int GetTickCount (void)

to

    DWORD GetTickCount (void);

And the prototye of `TIMERPROC` changed from

    typedef BOOL (* TIMERPROC)(HWND, int, DWORD)

to

    typedef BOOL (* TIMERPROC)(HWND, LINT, DWORD)

##### Miscellaneous

In addition, we correct the bad or wrong definitions of some APIs:

  * `DWORD2PIXEL` to `DWORD2Pixel`. The old one has a bad name.
  * `GetWindowRendererFromName`: The return type changes from
    `const WINDOW_ELEMENT_RENDERER*` to `WINDOW_ELEMENT_RENDERER*`.
    So you can overload some methods directly of a renderer.
  * `GetDefaultWindowElementRenderer`: The return type changes from
    `const WINDOW_ELEMENT_RENDERER*` to `WINDOW_ELEMENT_RENDERER*`.
    So you can overload some methods directly of the default renderer.

### Configuration option changes

We add some new options for autoconf script (`configure`):

  * `--with-runmode`: Now you can use this option to specify the runtime
    mode of MiniGUI. The old enable options for runmode were removed.
    Note that MiniGUI-Processes now is the default runmode.

  * `--enable-develmode`: You should use this option to define `_DEBUG` macro,
    enable `-Wall -Werror` option, and enable all features of MiniGUI,
    if you were a MiniGUI developer.
